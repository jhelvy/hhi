This Shiny app provides an interactive illustration of the [Herfindahl–Hirschman index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index) (HHI).

HHI is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry they are in and is an indicator of the amount of competition among them.

The app itself was originlly created by Jake Springer (@JakeS2028) and is hosted on shinylive.io.
